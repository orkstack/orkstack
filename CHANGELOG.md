# Changelog

All notable changes to OrkStack are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions
will follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) from the
first release. OrkStack has not reached 1.0: until it does, a release may
include breaking changes, and each is marked **BREAKING**.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** every Orkflow begins with `apiVersion: orkstack/v1` and
  `kind: Orkflow`. A document without them is refused at validate, apply and
  plan, naming the two lines to add. The header is not part of the definition:
  digests, derived versions and memo keys are unchanged, a version stored
  before this release still reads, runs and diffs, and applying it again with
  the two lines added as its first YAML lines, above or below its comments, is
  a no-op (docs/DSL.md, "The document header").
- **BREAKING:** `orkctl apply` decides what a file is by its `kind:`
  (`Orkflow` or `Automation`) and refuses a file with neither, before anything
  is sent.
- **BREAKING:** an automation document's schedule `input:` is a YAML mapping.
  A JSON object written as a string is refused, naming the YAML form: remove
  the quotes. `orkctl export` writes `input:` as a mapping.
- **BREAKING:** data written in an Orkflow — `inputs:`, `with:`,
  `await.schema` — becomes JSON through one strict mapping: a plain value YAML
  readers resolve differently (`yes`, `on`, `0755`, `1:30`, `1e3`, a date), a
  number JSON cannot hold exactly, and tags, anchors, aliases and merge keys
  are refused, naming the path (docs/JSON.md, "Data written in an authored
  document"). A document that compiled before either compiles to the same
  definition or is refused; none changes silently.
- A stored Orkflow version is shown with its header wherever OrkStack shows its
  YAML (`orkctl orkflow get --json`, `edit`, `diff`, the UI). Evidence bundles
  keep the source verbatim.
